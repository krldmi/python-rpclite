This rpclite package introduces some additions to Pythons standard
xmlrpclib and SimpleXMLRPCServer. Some of it (if not most) will be
obsolete in Python 2.6

It introduces:

  * Keywordes arguments, like:
    server.get_something(*params, timeout=11)

  * Threaded and forking XML-RPC servers:
    BlockingXMLRPCServer, ThreadingXMLRPCServer and ForkingXMLRPCServer,
    where XMLRPCServer = ThreadingXMLRPCServer	

    Therefor, also, introducing the possibility to register classes
    (instead of instances), so connections and threads can have separate
    instances of a registered class.
